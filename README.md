# snaky-app

Lightweight local password manager. Snaky only provides a convenient interface for storing your passwords, but does not guarantee their security.


### Configuration

Schematic of the password file (located in `documents/snaky/snaky.json`)

```
[
    {
        "link": "",
        "name": "",
        "password": "",
    },

    ...

    {
        "link": "",
        "name": "",
        "password": "",
    }
]
```
